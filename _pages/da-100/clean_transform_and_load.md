This section is all about power query.  For both the exam and for dealing with customers, you should be comfortable with all the GUI options within the Power Query screen. Please note the use of the words “all” and “comfortable”. You should also have at least a basic knowledge of M, though I won’t use either the words “all” or “comfortable” when describing the skill level of M for the exam.
