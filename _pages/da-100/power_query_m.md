Yes, the exam authors thought it would be helpful if people weren't scared of the "advanced" screen in Power Query, and were also able to make use of the ability to add calculated columns in Power Query. 

why have to learn two different ways to add a calculated column in the same toolset (Power Query and DAX)? Remember, we get better performance when doing things like this upstream. A calculated column created in Power Query will have better performance than a calculated column created in DAX. 

A great way to learn more about this is the 30 day query folding challenge from Itâ€™s Not About the Cell, available here:
