This is another one that you are unlikely to encounter in a simple lab environment, where file paths are set as part of the exercise. But outside of the lab environment, you will need to deal with source files being moved, or changing from the dev server to the prod server, etc. Here’s one simple exercise to work with this feature:

- Create a report based on a file (csv, excel, whichever).
- Save and close the report
- Move the file to another folder on your drive
- Open the report, and fix things so that you can refresh successfully again.

To get started with this, check out the “data source settings” button in the Power Query window.
