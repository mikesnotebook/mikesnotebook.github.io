Again, if your source system was designed by Mary Poppins and is practically perfect in every way, you likely won’t need this info. In case Mary Poppins wasn’t on the team, you’ll need to deal with databases that stored dates as strings, and ints as floats, and all kinds of other issues. Hopefully, you never have to deal with tables that store time zone info and have to do anything with it, as that way lies insanity.
