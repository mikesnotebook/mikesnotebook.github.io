From an exam perspective, items like this allow Microsoft to ask any questions they'd like about tables. But as a reminder, table design will impact performance, usability, and the ease of creating needed calculations, aggregations, etc. While the title of this section is so simple, this topic encompasses quite a bit of database theory. How many tables?  What fields go in the table? What data goes in the fields? 

But without trying to re-write all the documentation here, I'll just remind you that the typical design of tables we're aiming for is a star schema. As mentioned earlier, opening the table relationship view and seeing a star schema is like sitting down in front of a fireplace in the winter, with a good beverage and a nice blanket. Don’t believe me? Work on a project with a disaster of a data model for a month or two, and then return to a project based on a beautiful star schema. You’ll feel the stress and tension lift off of you.
