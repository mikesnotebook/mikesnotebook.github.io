I have basic skills at cooking, strategy games, and growing basil. I make hummus that people who were born and raised in the Middle East say is pretty good. I can change a diaper, play the trombone, and bait a hook. I make a great French omelet. I enjoy reading about Supreme Court Justices, Ancient Greek naval strategy, and 16th century Saints. I spend most days working with Office 365, PowerApps, Flow, Azure, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PowerShell, SQL, Power BI, SSRS, and a couple othersâ€¦
